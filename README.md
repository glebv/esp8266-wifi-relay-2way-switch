# WiFi Relay 2Way Switch

The project is based on esp8266-07 or 12 and can work with [home-assistant.io](https://home-assistant.io/) via MQTT. It designed for case when you want to control e.g. a light manually by a switch or remotely from home automation server or mobile app.

#### Key features:
- work via WiFi and reconnecting in case of a failure
- supporting of MQTT communicating and reconnecting in case of a failure
- the solution can work without WiFi and unavailability of MQTT broker
- the relay can be managed by the switch on the board or by MQTT signal

### TODO
- installation
- circuit
- etc...
